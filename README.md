This repository is designed to house computer programs that either simulate or solve problems that one might encounter in a Chemistry, Physics, Engineering or Mathematics textbook.

# TODO (Render Engine):

1. [] Abstract the elements of the render engine into classes that make it easy to modify and add on to. Should be abstract for use
      with 2D and 3D graaphics.
    - Create UML Diagram indicating the relationships.
    - Potential objects: Display/Window, Model, Shader, Vertex Array Object, Vertex Buffer Object, Element Buffer Object,
      Camera, Scene, Renderer, Resource Manager, etc.
    - Things should be easily extendable such as creating a different camera or create UI elements later on.
2. [] Create and write the header files.
3. [] Implement the headers into source files.
