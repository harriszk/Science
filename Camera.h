 * 
 * This class represents a virtual camera in 3D space. It determines the view and projection 
 * matrices used to render the scene. The view matrix transforms world space to camera space 
 * and the projection matrix transforms camera space to clip space. See: https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Camera
 * for more info. It also provides methods for manipulating the camera's position and orientation, 
 * such as moving forward, backward, strafing, etc.
